# KdTree
   Use KdTree data structure to conduct efficient insertions and searches in a 2D plane in guaranteed logarithmic time. 
   Compile the .java files and run the .class files against algs4.jar, because many APIs from algs4.jar were imported into the java codes.
   Test clients: NearestNeighborVisualizer, RangeSearchVisualizer, and KdTreeVisualizer.
